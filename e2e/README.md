# End To End (e2e) Tests

The purpose of the E2E tests is to have a simple (currently) test that gives maintainers some confidence when adding new resources/tools. It does this by:
 * Building the `terraform-mcp-server` docker image
 * Running the image
 * Interacting with the server via stdio
 * Issuing requests that interact with the existing Resources/Tools

## Running the Tests

A service must be running that supports image building and container creation via the `docker` CLI.

```
HCP_TFE_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN> make test-e2e
```

### Note: providing a `HCP_TFE_TOKEN` is only necessary if TFE Resource/Tools are wanting to be tested. If not set they'll be skipped since TFE related tests contain the following:
```go
		if e2eServerToken == "" {
			t.Skip("HCP_TFE_TOKEN environment variable is not set, skipping")
		}
```

Running the tests:

```
